#Interactive-Counter-Project <br>
This is a counter project built with HTML, CSS & made interactive with JavaScript<br>
The HTML & CSS are basic and contain little codes while the JavaScript contained the functionality to make the counter-app interactive<br>
This code can be used in any other project that needs a counter-app<br>
Incase the numbers need to be negative or more than 50, then the (IF statement) in the JavaScvript file can be modified.
